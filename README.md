# Python-EDA-Project-for-Data-Analysis
🛍️ Diwali Retail Sales Analysis – Python Project
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Diwali-season sales data from a retail mall selling food, clothing, and electronics. Using Python-based data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project uncovers key sales trends, customer behavior insights, and seasonal patterns unique to the festive period.

🔧 Features & Techniques Used

📌 Data Preprocessing:

1.] Handling missing values

2.] Data cleaning and formatting

3.] Removing duplicates and inconsistencies

📌 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1.] Visualizing sales distribution across product categories

2.] Identifying top-performing segments

3.] Studying customer demographics and purchase behavior

4.] Highlighting Diwali-specific seasonal spikes

📌 Python Libraries:

1.] Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and more

2.] Insights & Visualizations:

3.] Category-wise and region-wise sales trends

4.] Behavior-based segmentation

5.] Revenue-driving products and patterns during the Diwali season

🎯 Conclusions

1.] Significant sales surges occur across food, clothing, and electronics during the Diwali period, showing clear festive buying behavior.

2.] Clothing and electronics exhibit the strongest seasonal spikes, driven by gift purchases and holiday offers.

3.] Customer segments such as young adults and families contribute notably to overall revenue.

The combination of preprocessing and EDA provides meaningful, data-backed insights that can help retailers optimize inventory, marketing strategies, and promotional planning for future festive seasons.
